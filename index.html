    <h1>The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
<h2><b>What I Learnt</b></h2>

<b>The Internet</b>
<p>The Internet is a connection of computers that form a network that allows information to be distributed around the Globe. 
  It is essentially made up of users sitting on their computers with normal screens
  and mice, and servers, computers that are designed to serve files quickly. 
  The user sends out a request to the sever using HTTP "<em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em>". 
  The server then sends back a file which is generally a HTML "<em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>" document.
</p>
<br>
<b>HTML - <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em></b>
<p>HTML documents form the basis of the internet as we see it on our browsers. 
  They contain text in a language that the browser can convert into  the webpages we are familiar with.
  This text uses <b>Tags</b> which can do simple things, like make text <b>BOLD</b> or
  <em>Italicized</em>. Or it can insert pictures, or links to other places - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">
    Such as this link to Wikipedia.</a>
</p>
<p>HTML documents are also broken down in sections which contain different sorts of information. There is the document type(these days generally just "HTML"), 
the title (The description in the browser title bar) , the header (containing CSS elements and other info), and
the body (which is where the main content goes. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48748025">As explained in this video</a>.</p>
<br>
<b>Inline Vs Block</b>
<p>There are 2 basic sorts of Tags (or elements). These are <b>inline</b> and <b>Block</b></p>
<p>As the name suggests, Inline, means that the tag doesn't interup the  line. The text would continue to flow.
<b>Bold</b>, <em>Italics</em>, images and links are examples of Inline tags</p>
<p> Block tags on the other hand create blocks of text within them. These paragraphs are written in the block p tags.
  Div, header and body are also block tags.
</p>
<br>
<b>You Don't Need to Know Everything'</b>
<p>Help is just a quick Google search away.</p>  
<p>
  Can't remember how to make text bold? just google, "html make text bold" <b>and the answer will quickly become apparent</b>.
</p>
<p>Just focus on learning the higher level information and a deeper understanding of how it all fits together 
  and then you can google the exact syntax of a language if you forget.
